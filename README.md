# Welcome to Choppit Server

## About
This is a project put together from lessons learned in two Deep Dive Coding boot camps Java + Android cohort 9 in 2020, and Fullstack Web cohort 33 in 2021.  Huge thanks are due to my instructors, classmates and the Deep Dive community.

Choppit is a smart cookbook app that uses HTML scraping to take the actual recipe out of all the ads, pop-ups, videos and walls of unhelpful text, so you can just cook.  It began as a solo project in Deep Dive Java; this iteration uses that Java backend with a UI I built (am building) using React.js and other tools from the Fullstack boot camp.  

When it's finished, there will also be a persistent database and RESTful API for the frontend to query. The whole thing will be packaged as a mini-monolithic service that can run on a home computer and simplify cooking for anyone on your home Wi-Fi.
